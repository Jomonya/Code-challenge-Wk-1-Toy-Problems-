# Code Challenges: Grader, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator

This repository contains solutions to three different challenges: a Student Grade Generator, a Speed Detector, and a Net Salary Calculator. These challenges are designed to test basic to intermediate JavaScript programming skills, focusing on conditional statements, mathematics, and user input handling.

## Description

- **Student Grade Generator**: Takes student marks as input (between 0 and 100) and outputs the corresponding grade based on a predefined scale.
- **Speed Detector**: Accepts a car's speed as input and calculates demerit points based on how much the speed exceeds a certain limit. It also determines if a license should be suspended after accumulating too many demerit points.
- **Net Salary Calculator**: Computes an individual's net salary by considering basic salary, benefits, and deductions including tax (PAYE), NHIF, and NSSF, using simplified rates for demonstration purposes.
